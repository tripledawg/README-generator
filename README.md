  ## Description:
  This command line application uses node to prompt users to create a professional README document.   
  ## Installation: 
  To use this application, download and unzip the file package from GitHub.  In your terminal navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file package.  In the terminal type    \node -v to make sure you have node installed.  If not, visit [nodeJS](nodejs.org) to download it.  Then while still in your terminal type    \npm install.  Next, type    \node index.js and follow the prompts and enjoy your README! 
  ## Usage: 
  When creating an open-source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important for developers to provide users a high-quality README for the app.  In this app, users are prompted for information about their application repository.  Users are required to enter a title, description, table of contents, usage information, installation instructions as well as GitHub username and some way to be reached for questions.  Information regarding licensing information, email, testing, contributions is optional and can be left black by the user.  Depending on user input, a table of contents is programmatically generated once the last question is answered.  In addition, if users would like to add a custom prefix to their README to prevent overwriting their sample README with their actual README, that is an option as well.
