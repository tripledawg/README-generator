  ## Description:
  How often have you asked "where should we go?" when planning a night out? Probably a few too many times. To try and address that challenge, we created a web application to give you some 'Dinner and a Movie' recommendations around you. This should give you and your partner a good starting point to plan a fun and memorable date night.This web app leverages several public APIs to generate a list of local recommendations. The TomTom search API helped collect a list of theaters in the area. TomTom's search API helped us produce a list of nearby restaurants. Currently you can not filter by cuisine type, which can be both an advantage and disadvantage when you are trying to coordinate the perfect evening. Additionally, OpenWeather's API was able to give us coordinates that were necessary for interacting with the other APIs. 
  ## Installation: 
  No special installation is needed beyond a browser such as Google Chrome.  
  ## Usage: 
  To use the app, input a zip-code into the search bar and click "go" or press "Enter" on your keyboard. Your screen will update with a randomly selected restaurant and movie theatre near the entered zip code. If you would like to generate a different restaurant, please click "reshuffle" under the "Restaurant" section. If you would like to generate a different movie theater, please click "reshuffle" under the "Movie Theater" section. Press "Go Back" at the bottom of the page if you would like to start over. If you would like to share the generated information, press the "share" button". At this point, your link should have been copied onto your clipboard, and you can paste the link wherever and send it.
